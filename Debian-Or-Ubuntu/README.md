### Installing brave browser in Debian,Ubuntu and their derivatives 
  
 
  >"Brave" is a popular browser, though you cannot download it directly from the distribution repositories. To help you with installing brave, I have made a shell script to do all the necessary procedures for you! :smiley:


To install Brave browser: **Copy the following as a whole** then, paste and run this in your terminal 
```
cd $HOME/Downloads
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/James-Willer/Random-solutions/main/Scripts/install_brave_deb.sh
chmod a+x install_brave_deb.sh
./install_brave_deb.sh
```


>Do you use Github Desktop? Here, this is the current version ðŸ˜‰ (**Copy as whole!**)
```
sudo wget https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases/download/release-2.9.4-linux1/GitHubDesktop-linux-2.9.4-linux1.deb

sudo apt-get install gdebi-core

sudo gdebi GitHubDesktop-linux-2.9.4-linux1.deb
